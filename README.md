## Overview

Kareem Quiz App is a simple quiz application developed using Python's tkinter library and the Open Trivia Database API. It presents users with multiple-choice questions retrieved from the API and allows them to select their answers through radio buttons. After answering each question, users receive instant feedback on whether their answer was correct or not. At the end of the quiz, the application displays the user's score as a percentage along with the number of correct and incorrect answers.

- **Score Calculation**: The application calculates the user's score and presents it as a percentage at the end of the quiz.
